### Color Glyphs - Interpolate

I was very happy with the representation I had already created for the colour red so I decided to use the same glyph for this part of the assignment.

The three dimensions have been interpolated in the following ways:

Hue determines the opacity level used for the fill colour of the triangles and outer circle.

Saturation determines how small the circles in the center of the square are. The smaller the circles are the less pure the colour.

Lightness determines how wide the triangles will be. Maximum lightness creates triangles so wide they almost fill the square.
