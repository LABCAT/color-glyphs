### Color Glyphs - Glyph Object

I decided to continue using the same glyph from my glyph system and made the following changes to provide better differentiation between fields of colours:

1. Combined the shapes from the saturation and brightness dimensions into one group which is now the hue dimension.

2. Moved the functionality from the old hue dimension into the saturation dimension.

3. Added a new shape to represent the brightness dimension - a black hexagon with a varying level a transparency.

At this point I still wasn't completely satisfied as the hue dimension didn't have enough variety when viewed at the smallest size.  I resolved this by adding rotational functionality and another smaller star to represent the hue dimension.
