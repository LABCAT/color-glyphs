### Color Glyphs - Glyph Object

To begin with I used the same glyph I had created for the glyph system. This worked reasonably well but still had a lot of room for improvement. 

I have made the following changes which have improved the glyph immensely:

1. Combined the shapes from the saturation and brightness dimensions into one group which is now the hue dimension.

2. Moved the functionality from the old hue dimension into the saturation dimension.

3. Added a new shape to represent the brightness dimension - a black hexagon with a varying level a transparency.
