### Color Glyphs - Glyph System

I decided that my glyph system would be inspired by the interpolation part of the assignment.  

The glyphs had been designed for a square shaped area and didn't fit within the circle area which meant I had to adjust the design in order to stay within the guidelines. As a result of this 
the glyph looks quite different than it did originally. However, visually it is still thematically related to the glyphs from the interpolation part of the assignment.  

I have tested my glyph system quite thoroughly and think that it works really well. When in oddball mode it is usually very easy to find the glyph that is not matching.
