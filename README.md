### Color Glyphs

I have chosen green as my colour and have used three trees to create a miniature forest as my monochrome representation.

To represent the colour blue I was inspired by the ocean and combined arcs and ellipses to create a globe.

For the colour yellow I created a pattern (from ellipses) that I perceive in different ways, sometimes I see a flower and sometimes I see the sun.

My representation of the colour red is inspired by the rising sun flag from Japan. There is a circle at the center and 16 triangles which grow from out of this.
