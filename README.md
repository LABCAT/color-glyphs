### Color Glyphs - Glyph System

I decided that my glyph system would be inspired by the interpolation part of the assignment.  

The glyphs had been designed for a square shaped area and didn't fit within the circle area. This meant I had to adjust the design in order to stay within the guidelines. As a result of this the glyph looks quite different than it did originally. However, visually it is still apparent that this glyph system is thematically related to the glyphs from the interpolation part of the assignment.  

I have thoroughly tested my glyph system and it works really well. When in oddball mode it is usually very easy to find the glyph that is not matching.
